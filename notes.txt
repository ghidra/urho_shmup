Notes:
---------------------
-i need to look at bullet speed causing it to miss collision
  -perhapse scale out the bounding box based on velocity.
  -so i will need to rotate the projectile to rotate along velocity

-pickups
  doesnt work now if I turn off the "main" weapons, as i assume its looking for it

-shaders
  make out line a different shade of color it finds
  give a depth a dialable banding


- i removed the bootleg rotation on ship movement

-add light flash on gun firing

-continue gun fixes


-ORIENTATION
  -LOOK DOWN +Z

-enemy class
  -fix orientation of enemies
  -when too far off screen they need to be removed

-weapon bank
  -control weapons from weapon bank
  -remove old build_weapon method from pawn (enemies also use it)

-weapon/projectile damage
  -weapon effects projectile damage
  -projectile has its own damage variable

-you died state

-extend factory to make factory1
  -this new child class will act as a level
  -so then we can hand build a level in these extended classes

-smarter pickups so that they are more procedural
  -so we dont need to manually set them up when we want to test certain shit.

fix the bar scaling messing up the position---- almost right
set pickups as a trigger and not actualy cause velicty changes as it does now


Perlin Noise:
---------------------
simplex works perlin does not


Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation (i have found the answer to this once, i forgot however)
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?

COLLISION LAYERS AND MASKS
--------------------------------
layers:                       masks:
000001 = (1)character          111100 (60)
000010 = (2)character bullets  111000 (56)
000100 = (4)pickups            100001 (33)
001000 = (8)enemy bullets      100001 (33)
010000 = (16)enemies           100011 (35) 110011 (51)(collide with other enemies)
100000 = (32)env               111111 (63)

from irc
--------------------
you would create a folder next to Data/ and CoreData/, eg: Resources/
and then you can either add that extra folder via angelscript, or via the commandline:
Urho3DPlayer.exe Scripts/Editor.as -w -s -pÂ ./CoreData;./Data;./Resources

--------
Core/Textures folder there is LUTIdentity.png
if you apply the color correction filter it uses this as a lookup
i would posterize and bump the saturation up on this image
whiter haze towards the sun which i would try with zone fog stuff
