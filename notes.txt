Question:
---------------------

-time manipulation
  -slow down time, this includes gravity in simulation
-need to figure out a way to disclude certain object from effecting some objects in sim
  -there appears to be a mask that can be used
-Can you have a single rig used with multiple meshes, with proper weights, for example, clothes for characters?
